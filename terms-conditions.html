                <h3 class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6 font-bold">Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    This Provision allows us to promptly and efficiently resolve any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or
                    negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between You
                    and Us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers
                    or third-party vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer
                    this because We believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can
                    award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate
                    in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Everyone agrees that, except as provided below, any and all disputes, as defined above, whether presently in existence or based
                    on acts or omissions in the past or in the future, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration rather than in court in accordance with this provision.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6 font-bold">Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h3>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give Us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing Us at <a class="text-secondary-800 underline" href="mailto:help@geniustag.com">help@geniustag.com </a>                    the following information: (1)Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of Your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief You seek. If We do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving Your notification,
                    then You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6 font-bold">Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h3>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    Notwithstanding the above, You or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT
                    YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at info@supportpets.com the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not
                    wish to resolve disputes with Us through arbitration. We promise that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will not negatively affect Your relationship with Us. But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline, so
                    keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6 font-bold">Arbitration Procedures</h3>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, will arbitrate all disputes,
                    and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to
                    decide, including the scope of this Provision.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance,
                    the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
                    Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute
                    of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">
                    <span class="font-medium">Arbitration Award –</span> The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the
                    benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties,
                    except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

                    still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses. In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law,
                    if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Us as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated
                    action or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified
                    above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You. Neither You, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without

                    had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights
                    are waived. Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g.,, the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">The Genius Tag Access Guarantee (Also referred to as “The Pet Access Guarantee” or “The Red Carpet Guarantee”, hereafter referred to as “The Guarantee”) is an agreement between Genius Tag and you, such that Genius Tag will provide a partial
                    refund for the price of the digital Emotional Support Animal (ESA) approval or renewal documents (“The Documents”) in the case that a “qualified access denial” occurs during the duration of your guarantee coverage.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">Coverage begins the later of: (1) 48 hours after The Guarantee is purchased, or (2) when you access The Documents for the first time. Coverage ends at 11:59pm Eastern Time one year after The Guarantee is purchased.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">A “qualified access denial” refers to an event in which your “official approved animal” is denied access to a location such as: store, restaurant, hotel, taxi, rideshare, or other public transportation (not including airplanes and interstate
                    trains or bus services).
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">The following exclusions apply to The Guarantee: The Guarantee is non-refundable. When the event location has a clearly-posted sign indicating that only service dogs are permitted on the premises at the time of the event, or when the “official
                    approved animal” is behaving in an inappropriate, aggressive, threatening, or disruptive manner at the time of the event, the event is not considered a “qualified access denial”. Only events that take place within the continental United
                    States are eligible to be considered “qualified access denial” events.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">The Guarantee does not cover the purchase price of The Guarantee or any additional items purchased with The Documents, such as certificates or physical documents that were mailed to you or any other physical or digital items purchased.
                    The Guarantee only covers refunds for the purchase price of digital documents. When the guarantee is purchased at a discount or at no cost, the refund amount may be reduced by the difference between the amount paid for The Guarantee
                    and the undiscounted price of The Guarantee, in order to cover the cost of The Guarantee.

                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">Non-custom Items like pet tags, leashes, vests and all other physical goods can be returned for a full refund within 30 days of your purchase. These item(s) must be returned back to our processing department in brand new, unused condition
                    and returned with its original packaging to provide your refund or exchange. The customer is responsible for shipping costs on all returns and exchanges.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">Customized ID cards and/or printed certificates cannot be returned or exchanged.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">In the unlikely event you are denied housing or travel accommodations with your pet due to a claim that your ESA letter is not valid, we will provide you with the informational resources to assist you. We cannot control entities that refuse
                    to follow federally mandated guidelines to accept your ESA letter and therefore cannot offer a refund should that happen in those rare occasions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">For all refund requests and questions, please email support@supportpets.com or give us a call at 1-855-700-PETS between the hours of 9am and 6pm EST Monday through Friday.
