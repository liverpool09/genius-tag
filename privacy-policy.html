                    use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information
                    from other sources. </p>
                <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-5 md:mb-6">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required

                    information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Support Pets also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and
